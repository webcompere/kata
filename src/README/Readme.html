<p>This is a refactoring challenge. Unlike normal refactoring challenges where the code is bad or isn't covered by unit tests, this one seems to be ok at first glance. Good test coverage and a simple problem. However, the code in this exercise smells funny and apparently there's a bug in it!</p>
<p>The challenge is to refactor this to a neat solution and fix the bug along the way.</p>
<h3>The SOS</h3>
<p>I’ve got some terrible news. I just wrote some awful code. It works, and passes its tests, but it’s really not very nice. I can read it, but I don’t like it, and I feel like it could be improved.</p>

<p>The good news is that if we refactor it then it will be easy to add more features. The code is part of a new dating website I'm making called "Mismatch.com – we guarantee your match will be a disaster". The algorithm is simple. It tries to match people of a similar age, with similar likes. People can also express dislikes and it avoids matching people where one person dislikes half or more of the other person's likes.</p>

<p>It should be easy to code, and the unit tests have been written with a very strong focus on the business logic, so it should be good.</p>

<p>The code, however, is a bit muggy looking. It's a shame. I thought I could do better.</p>
